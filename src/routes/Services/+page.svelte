	<h2>Pricing Tiers</h2>
	<p>
		Every project is unique, and pricing varies based on scope and complexity. My goal is to deliver
		exceptional results while keeping costs fair and equitable. All projects come with a free year
		of support to ensure your website stays up and running.
	</p>

	<section class="block-List">
		<h3>Simple $500 - $1000</h3>
		<p>
			Perfect for those who know exactly what they need. You provide the vision, including the color
			scheme, features, and design preferences, and I bring it to life with a static or lightly
			functional website.
		</p>

		<h3>Moderate $1000 - $3000</h3>
		<p>
			Ideal if you have a general idea but need some guidance to shape your vision. Together, we’ll
			refine your ideas into a cohesive, functional website. This is going to be more than just a
			static page.
		</p>

		<h3>"I’ll Handle It" $4000+</h3>
		<p>
			For when you have a jumble of brilliant ideas but need someone to make them happen. We’ll
			collaborate to turn your concepts into a polished, professional site. This can be complex and
			include E-commerce or CMS services.
		</p>

			<strong>Planning:</strong> We’ll discuss your goals, brainstorm ideas, and create a clear plan
			for your website.

			and message.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Testing:</strong> Every detail will be tested across different devices and browsers to
			ensure it works seamlessly.

			<strong>Deployment:</strong> Your website goes live and is ready to make an impact!

			<strong>Support:</strong> Enjoy free support for the first year to address any unforeseen issues
			or updates.
