		<h1>West Sound Roller Derby Website: A Month of Building Something Special</h1>
		<p>
			This project marked a big step forward in both complexity and refinement, expanding on
			previous ideas of managing and interacting with website content directly from the page. Over
			the course of nearly a month, I built a website that offers a rich user experience, integrates
			multiple functionalities, and is designed with both users and administrators in mind.

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>
			This project not only showcased my ability to organize data and manage page structures
			effectively, but it also allowed me to refine my code for better readability and scalability.
			The website combines a rich user system, detailed forms, and multiple interactive features to
			support both skaters and administrators alike.
		</p>
		<p>
			The user manual I wrote for this site serves as a testament to its depth and usability, and
			I'm proud of the month-long journey that brought it to life. From ticket sales to roster
			profiles, WSRD now has a powerful tool to engage with their community and grow their sport.
